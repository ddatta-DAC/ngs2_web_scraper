R&DSpillovers and the Geography of Innovation
and Production
By DAVID B. AUDRETSCH AND MARYANN P. FELDMAN*

More than most othereconomic activities,
innovationand technologicalchange depend
upon new economic knowledge.Thus, Paul
Romer (1986), Paul Krugman(1991a, b),
and Gene Grossmanand ElhananHelpman
(1991), among others,have focused on the
role that spillovers of economic knowledge
acrossagentsand firmsplay in generatingincreasing returns and ultimately economic
growth. In fact, several recent studies have
identifiedthe existence of spatially-mediated
knowledgespillovers.An importantfindingof
Adam B. Jaffe (1989), Zoltan Acs et al.
(1992, 1994), andFeldman(1994a, b) is that
investmentin R&D by privatecorporations
and universities"spills over" for third-party
firmsto exploit.If the abilityto receiveknowledge spilloversis influencedby distancefrom
the knowledgesource, then geographicconcentrationshould be observed,especially in
industries where knowledge spillovers are
likely to play a moreimportantrole. The purpose of this paperis to examinethe extentto
which industrialactivityclustersspatiallyand
to linkthisgeographicconcentration
to the existenceof knowledgeexternalities.Of course,

as Jaffe et al. (1993) point out, one obvious
explanationwhy innovativeactivity in some
industriestendsto clustergeographicallymore
thanin otherindustriesis thatthe locationof
productionis more concentratedspatially.
Thus,in explainingwhy the propensityfor innovativeactivityto clustergeographicallyvaries acrossindustries,we need firstto explain,
and then to controlfor, the geographicconcentrationof the locationof production.
As Alfred Marshall (1920) and, later
Krugman(1991b) argue,there may be geographicboundariesto informationflows or
knowledgespillovers,particularly
tacitknowledge, among the firms in an industry.Although the cost of transmittinginformation
may be invariantto distance,presumablythe
cost of transmitting
knowledgerises with distance.Thatis, proximityand locationmatter.
While thereis considerableevidencesupporting the existenceof knowledgespillovers,neitherJaffe(1989), Jaffeet al. (1993), norAcs
et al. (1992, 1994), andFeldman(1994a) actually examinethe propensityfor innovative
activityto clusterspatially.But implicitin the
knowledgeproductionfunctionmodel is the
assumptionthat innovative activity should

NUMBER OF INNOVATIONS BY STATE

the greatest number of innovations were registered, followed by New York, New Jersey,
and Massachusetts. A particularlystriking feature shown in Figure 1 is that the bulk of innovative activity in the United States occurs
on the coasts, and especially in California and
in New England. By contrast, no innovative
activity is registered in certain Midwestern
states such as North Dakota, South Dakota,
Montana, and Wyoming.4 States in the traditional manufacturing belt such as Ohio, Illi-

4 Of course, simply comparing the absolute amount of
innovative activity across states ignores the fact that the
manufacturingbase of some states is larger than others.
Presumably one of the most importantdeterminantsof innovative activity is the location of manufacturingactivity.
Additional information on the geographic distribution of
the innovation data can be found in Feldman (1994b) and
Feldman and Florida ( 1994).

nois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are not at all
particularlyinnovative. Thus, while the location of manufacturingactivity may explain the
spatial distribution of innovative activity to
some degree, it is certainly not the only factor.
This presentation of the aggregate geographic distribution of innovative activity in
the United States obscures the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster spatially within
specific industries.Thus, the distributionof innovative activity for the seven most innovative
four-digit standard industrial classification
(SIC) industries is shown in Table 1. A striking result is that the spatial concentration of
innovative activity in particular industries is
considerably greater than for all of manufacturing. For example, in the computer industry,
342 of the 821 innovations recorded, or 41.7
percent, are in California. And an additional
10 percent are recorded in Massachusetts.

industries?Oneobviousansweris simplythat
the locationof productionis moregeographically concentratedin some industriesthanin
others.Thisraisesthe issue of endogeny.Jaffe
et al. (1993) identify two relatedcriticalissues which must be consideredin trying to
identifywhy thepropensityfor innovativeactivity to clusterspatiallyvaries acrossindustries. First, the extent to which the location
of productionis geographicallyconcentrated
must be controlledfor, so that the relevant
question becomes: even after accounting for
the geographic concentration of the production location, why does the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster vary across in-

dustries?And second,in tryingto accountfor
the degreeto whichthe locationof production
is geographicallyconcentrated,an important
factoris the role which knowledgespillovers
play in the industry.It is only afterthe geographicconcentrationof productionhas been
controlledfor, that the degree to which innovativeactivityclustersspatiallycan be addressed.Thus, to explain the propensityfor
innovativeactivityto clusterspatiallywe begin with the extent to which productionis
geographicallyconcentrated.
While it is not possibleto directlymeasure
the extent to which knowledgeexternalities
exist, as Kenneth J. Arrow (1962) and
Krugman(1991a) point out, it is possible to
identify industriesin which new economic
knowledgeplays a relativelymore important
role. This is done on the basis of the industry
R&D intensity,or R&D-salesratio.The crucial assumptionwe make here is Arrow's
(1962) argumentthat knowledge spillovers
aremoreimportantin, andreflectedat leastto
some degreeby, highlyR&D-intensiveindustries. By contrast,such knowledgeexternalities, while perhapsstill present,play a less
importantrole wherethe creationof new economicknowledge,as reflectedby R&Dintensity, is negligible. Thus, the location of
productionwouldbe expectedto be moreconcentratedin thoseindustrieswhereknowledge
spilloversare prevalent,that is in industries

Loesch (1954) and Victor R. Fuchs (1962)
argue that firms in industries with a high dependency on naturalresource inputs will tend
to locate in close proximity to those resources.
Therefore, a higher content of naturalresource
inputs in an industry should result in a greater
geographic concentration of the location of
production. In addition, Robert C. Shelburne
and Robert W. Bednarzik (1993) argue that
industries which are more capital-intensive
will tend to be geographically concentrated,
since production will be concentrated among
fewer enterprises. That is, as capital intensity
and the importance of scale economies rise,
fewer large establishments will be able to exist
at a level of output in excess of the minimum
efficient scale (MES) level of output.
The main hypothesis of this paper suggests
that innovative activity will tend to cluster in
industries where new economic knowledge
plays an especially important role. In estimating the main influences on the geographic

may be that this measure limits the size of the
market to the United States, but when many
manufacturing industries are global in scale,
this measure will be understated.
There is little ambiguity concerning the two
measures that are the primaryfocus of this paper-the relative importanceof industryR&D
in an industryand the extent to which the labor
force is composed of skilled workers. The coefficient of industry R&D is positive and
clearly statistically significant, supporting the
hypothesis that industries where new economic knowledge tends to play a more important role will have a higher propensity to
cluster together. Similarly, industries where
skilled labor is relatively important also tend
to exhibit a greater degree of geographic concentration of production.
An alternative specification which includes
the Gini coefficient of innovation is presented
in equation (2) of Table 5. To the extent that
geographic proximity between R&D labs and

production facilities is important to gain the
benefits of R&D, we might expect that industries with closely clustered innovations may
also have closely clustered factories. However,
the coefficient of this variable cannot be considered to be statistically different from 0.
Equations (4) and (5) of Table 5 present
the OLS regression results estimating the Gini
coefficients of innovative activity across
states. Equation (4) indicates that, when the
extent to which productionactivity is geographically concentrated is not controlled for, the
coefficients of all three types of knowledgegeneratingmeasuresincluded-industry R&D,
skilled labor,and universityresearch-are positive and statistically significant. However, industries in which new economic knowledge
plays a more importantrole also tend to exhibit
a greater degree of spatial concentration.That
is, without first controlling for the extent to
which the location of productionis geographically concentrated,it is not at all clear whether

the greaterpropensityfor innovative activity to
cluster in industries where knowledge spillovers are more prevalent is attributableto the
fact that knowledge externalitiesare more conducive to innovative activity or simply that the
firms are already located within a relatively
tight geographic area.
Thus, in equation (5) of Table 5, the Gini
measure of the value-added across states is included. The coefficient of this variable is statistically insignificant, but the coefficients of
the other explanatory variables remain virtually unchanged. Which is to say that, even after controlling for the extent to which the
location of production is geographically concentrated, the three knowledge-generating
variables are still found to have a significant
impact on the propensity for innovative activity to cluster spatially.
Table 6 presents the 3SLS method of estimation. In the first set of equations the Gini
coefficient of innovative activity across states
is endogenous in both equations. In the second
set of equations a fully specified simultaneous
version of the model is presented in which the
Gini coefficients of both innovative activity
and production are endogenously included.
Most importantly, the propensity for innovative activity to spatially cluster is found to be

the result of new economic knowledge and not
merely the existing geographic concentration
of production.
The positive coefficients of industry R&D,
skilled labor, and university research, even after controlling for the degree of concentration
of production, using both the OLS and 3SLS
methods of estimation, are certainly consistent
with the following hypothesis. The propensity
for innovative activity to cluster will tend to
be higher in industries where new economic
knowledge plays a more important role. Presumably, it is in such industries where new
economic knowledge which generates innovative activity is transmitted tacitly through
what has been described as knowledge spillovers. Therefore, innovative activity is more
likely to occur within close geographic proximity to the source of that knowledge, be it a
university research laboratory, the research
and development departmentof a corporation,
or exposure to the knowledge embodied in a
skilled worker.
Industries where new economic knowledge
plays a more importantrole also tend to exhibit
a greater geographic concentration of production. However, based on the statistical results
reported above it appears that the propensity
for innovative activity to cluster spatially is

more attributable to the influence of knowledge spillovers and not merely the geographic
concentration of production.
IV. Conclusions
This paper examines the geography of innovation and production. In particular, by
examining the concentrationof economic phenomena, we re-focus the lens from the usual
product dimension to a geographic or spatial
dimension. A key assumption we make in examining the link between knowledge spillovers in an industry and innovative activity
clustering spatially is that knowledge externalities are more prevalent in industries where
new economic knowledge plays a greaterrole.
New economic knowledge is captured by industry R&D, university R&D, and skilled
labor.
One obvious complication in testing for this
link is that innovative activity will be more
geographically concentrated in industries
where production is also geographically concentrated,simply because the bulk of firms are
located within close proximity. Even more
problematic, though, is the hypothesis that
new economic knowledge will tend to shape
the spatial distribution of production as well
as that of innovation. Indeed, we find that a
key determinantof the extent to which the location of productionis geographically concentrated is the relative importance of new
economic knowledge in the industry. Even after controlling for the concentration of production we find evidence that industries in
which knowledge spillovers are more prevalent-that is where industry R&D, university
research and skilled labor are the most important-have a greaterpropensity for innovative
activity to cluster than industrieswhere knowledge externalities are less important.
